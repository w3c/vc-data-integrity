      A Linked Data signature is used for digital signatures on RDF Datasets. The default canonicalization mechanism is specified in the RDF Dataset Normalization specification, which deterministically names all unnamed nodes. Importantly, a `BbsBlsSignatureProof2020` is in fact a proof of knowledge of an unrevealed BbsBlsSignature2020 enabling the ability to selectively reveal information from the set that was originally signed. Each of the statements produced by the normalizing process for a JSON-LD document featuring a <a href=”#BbsBlsSignatureProof2020">`BbsBlsSignatureProof2020`</a> represent statements that were originally signed in producing the `BbsBlsSignature2020` and represent the denomination under which information can be selectively disclosed.

    domain: sec:Signature
    range: xsd:string
    comment: |
      This property is used in conjunction with the input to the signature hashing function in order to protect against replay attacks. Typically, receivers need to track all nonce values used within a certain time period in order to ensure that an attacker cannot merely re-send a compromised packet in order to execute a privileged request.

  - id: canonicalizationAlgorithm
    label: Canonicalization algorithm
    domain: sec:Signature
    comment: |
      The canonicalization algorithm is used to transform the input data into a form that can be passed to a cryptographic digest method. The digest is then digitally signed using a digital signature algorithm. Canonicalization ensures that a piece of software that is generating a digital signature is able to do so on the same set of information in a deterministic manner.

      A `verificationMethod` may be referenced by its identifier (a URL) or expressed in full.
      The aforementioned proofs are created to prove that some entity is delegating the authority to take some action to another entity. A verifier of the proof should expect the proof to express a `proofPurpose` of `capabilityDelegation` and reference a `verificationMethod` to verify it. The dereferenced `verificationMethod` MUST have a controller property that has a property of `capabilityDelegation` that references the `verificationMethod`.

      The public key multibase property is used to specify the multibase-encoded version of a public key. The contents of the property are defined by specifications such as ED25519-2020 and listed in the Linked Data Cryptosuite Registry. Most public key type definitions are expected to:
      • Specify only a single encoding base per public key type as it reduces implementation burden and increases the chances of reaching broad interoperability.
      • Specify a multicodec header on the encoded public key to aid encoding and decoding applications in confirming that they are serializing and deserializing an expected public key type.
      • Use compressed binary formats to ensure efficient key sizes.

      The x509CertificateFingerprint property is used to associate an X.509 Certificate with a proof via its fingerprint. The value is a multihash encoded then multibase encoded value using the base64pad variant. It is RECOMMENDED that the fingerprint value be the SHA-256 hash of the X.509 Certificate.
